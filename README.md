# Water_Sim_Modern_OpenGL
A basic implementation of Gerstner wave fucntion. The Gerstner wave function was originally developed long before computer graphics to model ocean water on a physical basis. As such, Gerstner waves contribute some subtleties of surface motion that are quite convincing without being overt.

The project contains a precompiled executible as well incase you are unable to run the solution file.
